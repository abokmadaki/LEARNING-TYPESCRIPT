## Introduction

TypeScript is a powerful programming language that adds static typing to JavaScript, enabling developers to catch errors early during the development process. It offers features such as type inference, interfaces, classes, and modules, which enhance the maintainability and scalability of JavaScript applications.

This project serves as a beginner-friendly introduction to TypeScript. It covers the basics, including variable declarations, function definitions, type annotations, interfaces, classes, modules, and more. By working through the examples and exercises in this project, you will gain a solid understanding of TypeScript and its core concepts.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/learning-typescript.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd learning-typescript`
3. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start the development server: `npm start`

## Project Structure

The project structure is as follows:

```
learning-typescript/
  ├── src/
  │   ├── examples/
  │   │   ├── example1.ts
  │   │   ├── example2.ts
  │   │   └── ...
  │   ├── exercises/
  │   │   ├── exercise1.ts
  │   │   ├── exercise2.ts
  │   │   └── ...
  │   └── index.ts
  ├── .gitignore
  ├── package.json
  ├── tsconfig.json
  └── README.md
```

- The `src/` directory contains the source code for examples and exercises.
- The `src/examples/` directory contains TypeScript files that demonstrate various concepts.
- The `src/exercises/` directory contains TypeScript files for practice exercises.
- The `src/index.ts` file serves as the entry point for running and testing the examples and exercises.
- The `.gitignore` file specifies files and directories to be ignored by version control.
- The `package.json` file lists the project dependencies and scripts.
- The `tsconfig.json` file contains the TypeScript compiler configuration.

## Usage

To run the examples or exercises, execute the following command:

```
npm start
```

This command will compile the TypeScript files and execute the resulting JavaScript code using Node.js. The output will be displayed in the console.

Feel free to modify the examples and exercises in the `src/` directory and experiment with the language features.
