The TypeScript Compiler
In order to make the compiler run every time you save and want to see a result in development, you can use (tsc app.ts --watch) || (tsc app.ts -w) to watch the file. Ctrl C to quit. 
For multiple files, tsc --init.
Then rerun tsc -w .


Explaining The 'tsconfig.json' (though most of them are explained in the comments beside the parameters)
 "exclude": [
-      "analytics.ts"
-    ],
-    "exclude": [
-      "*.dev.ts" - for wild cards
-    ]
include - opp of exclude
files - include for whole files
node_modules are excluded by default
Source Map helps with debugging, helps you see the ts files (.js.map) in source area
    -  "outDir": "./",                                   /* Specify an output folder for all emitted files. */ 
    For example, in projects, you might have a source folder for ts files and a dist folder for js files
-  "rootDir": "./",  
Making sure that typescript compiler looks only at the rootDir and the folder structure kept in the rootDir is the same and kept in the outDir 
- removeComments to emit all comments
- noEmit - TypeScript compiler will run without generating output files
- downlevelIteration : more exact compilation for lowerlevel js code, if you have loops and they behavve differently than you expect
- noEmitOnError - doesn't generate output files if error is found if any files
- noImplicitAny - ensure clarity on type declaration
- strictNullChecks - lets values that may hold a null value exist
- strictBindCallApply - paid attention but don't understand. works for bind call and apply, i haven't used it in js before.
